## Installation

run `npm install` in a terminal in the same folder as index.html

## Running

Vite is used to run a development server for live reloading.  `https://vitejs.dev`

run `npm run dev` to start the development server

open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

if using Chrome (or Brave) press F12 in the browser and in the top-right corner of devtools click on Toggle Device Toolbar which will show the page as though it's a mobile device.  The dimensions used for development were 360 x 640, which is the resolution of a Samsung Galaxy S5

## Creating a build

run `npm run build`.  This will create a file called `jsonForms.html` in the `dist` folder
